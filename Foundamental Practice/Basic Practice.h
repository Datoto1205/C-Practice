}
// 1. fgets() function could be used to ask user to type something.
// 2. scanf() function could be used to ask users to type something, too. However, the disadvantages of it were more than that of fgets() function. First of all, it is less secure. Moreover, it only would show "one" words & string & number; it would see space & return as a sign of the end of the function. Thus, I had better avoid to use scanf() function.
// 3. I had better not to use gets() function, the reason is that if user type too much things or I assume that the users would type too more things, I would face warnings, and the program would end immediately.
// 4. I had better not to put the fgets() function behind the scanf() function, the fact is that the output of scanf() function would involve a "\n", which may disable the fgets() behind the scanf()/
// 5. To get more information about the suspension of program because of the relative order of fgets() and scanf() function, please visit the website at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4929338/problem-with-scanf-and-fgets or https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/C_and_CPP/M.1310481378.A.137.html

    printf("result: %d \n", strcmp(sourceOfStringArray, anotherStringIWantToCompare));
    
    
    char theStringIWantToSearch = 'C';
    printf("%lu \n", strchr(sourceOfStringArray, theStringIWantToSearch));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(sourceOfStringArray); i++) {
        if (theStringIWantToSearch == sourceOfStringArray[i]) {
            printf("%d", i + 1);
        }
    } /* It could be used to mock the rationale of strstr() function. */
    
    return 0;
}
// 1. strcmp() function could be used to compare two strings. If these two strings are the same, then the output would be 0, or the output would be some positive numbers or negative numbers.
// 2. strchr() function could be used to track whether there's any the same element in the original longer string. If the answer is yes, then the output would be the address of that element in that string, or the output would be null.
// 3. It seems that strstr() function could be used to check whether there's any the same element in the original longer string, too. If the answer is yes, then the output of this function would be the order of the same element in that original string. However, it is a little hard for me to use this function. Therefore, I used another way, which is the combination of for-loop and if, to substitute strstr() function.
