## Introduction

In order to learn the knowledge about procedure-oriented, I tried to learn how to write C codes. I put the codes I wrote during the process of practice in the folder of 'Practice 1'. After I obtained some fundamental knowledge about C, which included control flow, struct, and array, I tried to answer the questions of programming found on LeetCode. I selected some questions to answer, and I put the codes of those questions in the folder of 'LeetCode Practice Report in C'.

## Software & Platform & Language

* Xcode 9
* C (C11)
